## Shivam Khandelwal

I am a motivated Artificial Intelligence practitioner with a vision to conduct high quality research in AI for mass benefit. Being a creative person myself, I believe that machines should be used to simplify everyday tasks so that people can be more creative and engage in artistic ventures, than being tired down with the monotonicity of their job. I have rich experience in NLP with deep learning and want to explore multiple tracks of this branch to combine cross domain knowledge to create solutions, like using NLP and cognitive computing for treatment of psychological diseases.

Prior to this, I also researched in battery technology for mobile devices and PHEVs.
